Details of these can be found on our \nwebsite axahealth.co.uk/services/businesshealthselect or call us. \nIf you need a GP referral \nWhen your GP says you need to see a specialist or have more treatment, tell them you \nhave health insurance and ask them for an \u2018open referral\u2019. We will accept referrals \nthrough a GP at your GP practice or through the AXA Doctor at Hand service.  \nWith an open referral your GP doesn\u2019t name a particular specialist, but instead gives \nyou the type of specialist you need to see, for example a cardiologist. We\u2019ll use your \nreferral to find you a specialist or relevant care service provider and make an \nappointment that works for you.  \nOccasionally the NHS will be best placed to provide care locally (for example specialist \npaediatric (children\u2019s) care at an NHS centre of excellence). When this is the case we \nwill talk to you about your NHS options as well. \n Starting your claim  \nContact us through your online account or on 0800 206 1808 before arranging any \ntreatment. \nIf your claim is urgent we recommend you call us so we can make sure you are covered \nfor your claim before you have any treatment.   \nWe may ask you to provide more information, for example from your GP or specialist. \nYou, your GP or your specialist must provide us with the information we ask for by the \ndate that we ask for it or you may not be covered for your claim. \nGetting a second opinion \nIf you would like a second opinion we can help you find a specialist we\u2019ll pay in full. \n \nThe AXA Doctor at Hand service - co nsultations by video or by phone \nThe AXA Doctor at Hand service offers you cover for video or phone consultations and can refer \nyou for private specialist treatment. \nAppointments available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year (subject to \nappointment availability).  \nWhen you contact the AXA Doctor at Hand service, you may be offered an appointment with a GP \nor another registered medical practitioner.  \nYou can use the AXA Doctor at Hand service for any medical condition or concern, whether or not \nthis would be covered under the other benefits of your plan. You should be aware that there are \nsome conditions that can\u2019t be assessed online, so you may need to make an appointment with \nyour GP instead. The service cannot help in an emergency. You should call an NHS ambulance or \ngo to an NHS A&E department. \nIf the medical practitioner at the AXA Doctor at Hand service says you need treatment, you must \ncall us to check that the treatment is covered.  \nPrivate prescriptions and delivery  \nIf the AXA Doctor at Hand service has prescribed medication, this can be delivered to an address \nof your choice. Private prescription and delivery charges are not covered by your plan.  \nAbout the AXA Doctor at Hand service terms  \nWhen you use the AXA Doctor at Hand service, you agree to the terms and conditions of the third  \nparty providing the service. You will be asked to review and confirm you agree to these when you \nregister.  \n \nHow we pay claims \nWe normally settle any bills directly with the specialist or the hospital where you\u2019ve had your \ntreatment. If your treatment is not covered for any reason, we will let you know. \nHow do you pay my medical bills? \nSpecialists and hospitals normally send their bills to us, so we can pay them directly. If you need to \npay an excess, we will let you know how to pay it. \n\u00bb For more details, see 5.2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3811, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "068ac3e7-8402-4224-8658-05e2000925ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "068ac3e7-8402-4224-8658-05e2000925ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_path": "data/pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3483406, "creation_date": "2025-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1b39dd7-73d7-4221-9bc2-a5927b3139e9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_path": "data/pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3483406, "creation_date": "2025-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-19"}, "hash": "49ca4819e510f6f7e22e2ae90ded26e4d2c83173541982ce1535870c5ab2e69f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Page 11 \nDo I need to tell the place where I have my treatment that I am an AXA Health member? \nYes you must tell the place where you have your treatment that you are an AXA Health member. \nThis will mean that the fees charged for your treatment are those we have agreed with the hospital \nor centre. \nWhat happens if I\u2019ve paid the bills myself already or if I receive a bill? \nIf you paid your medical bills yourself and your treatment is covered, we will refund you the rates \nwe have agreed with the hospital or centre, minus any excess.

Your \nGP may charge you for providing this information. This charge is not covered by your plan. \nx We may also ask you to give us consent to access your medical records. \nx In some cases, we may also ask you to complete additional forms. We will need you to complete \nthese forms as soon as possible, but no later than 6 months after your treatment starts (unless \nthere is a good reason why this is not possible). \nx Very rarely, we may have to ask a specialist to advise us on the medical facts or examine you. In \nthese cases, we will pay for the specialist to do this and will take your personal circumstances \ninto account when choosing the specialist. \nWhat happens if I don\u2019t want to give the information you\u2019ve asked for? \nIf you do not give us information we ask for, or do not consent to our accessing your medical \nrecords when we ask, we will not be able to assess your claim and so will not be able to pay it. We \nmay also ask you to pay back any money that we have previously paid to do with this medical \ncondition. \nWhat if my treatment isn\u2019t covered? \nIf your membership does not cover your treatment, we\u2019ll explain this and also tell you about what \nwe can do to support you through your NHS treatment. \nWhat if I want to see a specific specialist? \nWe always recommend that you ask your GP for an open referral. That\u2019s a referral that does not \nname a specialist. With an open referral, you\u2019ll have a choice of specialist and we can make your \nappointment for you. This will mean we can check that we cover that specialist\u2019s fees. \nHowever, if you would prefer to use a specific specialist, or if your GP has already named a \nspecialist, simply contact us as soon as you can and we can tell you whether we cover that \nspecialist\u2019s fees.

We will only pay for an equivalent higher cost drug if there is evidence that \ndrug will give a better clinical outcome. \nAre there any additional requirements for surgical treatments? \nIf the treatment is a surgical procedure it must also be listed and identified in our schedule of \nprocedures and fees. \n\u00bb You can find our schedule at axahealth.co.uk/fees or call us on 0800 206 1808 and we\u2019ll send \nyou a copy \nAre there any additional requirements for medical devices? \nIf the treatment involves a medical device (including surgical devices and implants), it must be \napproved by current EU Medical Device Regulation. When we say medical device we mean any \ninstrument, implant or other item that the manufacturer intended to be used for humans.  \nMedical devices must have moderate or high quality evidence that they are safe and effective from \neither: \nx systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials; or \nx clinical trial evidence with three years of follow-up data. \nWhat happens if my specialist says I need treatment that is not conventional \ntreatment? \nWe know our members may want to have access to developing treatments as they become \navailable. Our general position is that there is no cover for treatment or surgery that are not \nconventional treatment. We call this unproven treatment. \nIn some cases we will consider covering surgery not listed in the schedule of procedures and fees. \nWe may also consider other treatments and diagnostic tests carried out by a specialist which are \nnot conventional treatments. We must agree to the treatment before you have it, including what \ncosts (if any) we will pay. \nThe cover for unproven treatment is more restrictive than for conventional treatments. We will \nonly pay for treatment that we agree is a suitable equivalent to conventional treatment. To \nunderstand what the equivalent conventional treatment is we will look at the treatment of other \npatients with the same medical condition and prognosis. Unproven treatment must have high \nquality evidence of its safety and take place in the UK. \nAre there restrictions on what you pay for unproven treatment? \nIf there is no suitable equivalent conventional treatment, there won\u2019t be any cover for the \nunproven treatment. \nThere is no cover for any costs if you are having treatment as part of a registered clinical trial.  \nIf we agree to pay for your unproven treatment, the most we will pay is up to the amount we \nwould pay for the equivalent conventional treatment. This is based on the UK average amount \nthat we would pay a fee-approved specialist and hospital in the Directory of Hospitals. \nDo I need to let you know if I want unproven treatment? \nYes, you or your specialist must contact us at least 10 working days before you have unproven \ntreatment. This is so we can get the full details of the treatment and the clinical evidence. We can \nalso support you with additional information and questions for your specialist before you have \ntreatment. \nThere will be no cover for unproven treatment if you do not contact us at least 10 days before you \nbook your treatment. You cannot pay for unproven treatment yourself and reclaim the costs from \nus. \nWe recommend you check with the hospital, specialist, anaesthetist and other providers how \nmuch they will charge for your treatment. Some unproven treatments can be expensive and it \nwill be your responsibility to pay any shortfall. \nWill there be any restrictions on my cover after I have had unproven treatment?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4799, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bee144ad-286f-4b80-bc10-886e6e53b529": {"__data__": {"id_": "bee144ad-286f-4b80-bc10-886e6e53b529", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_path": "data/pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3483406, "creation_date": "2025-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fcf1ed85-0540-44a6-9dc0-af1d162eadba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_path": "data/pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3483406, "creation_date": "2025-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-19"}, "hash": "cf946e696ab4bf9cd81d14f7a401cfb861a6e6f14ccd20d6bcbd1444006f16ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "389098cd-890a-4a94-8cc7-69c3b052a732", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_path": "data/pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3483406, "creation_date": "2025-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-19"}, "hash": "0ebd3efc3b8514a05b330e1811f702e5878ab813ac3b73ac4a5016f08eceffe6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Do I need to let you know if I want unproven treatment? \nYes, you or your specialist must contact us at least 10 working days before you have unproven \ntreatment.

Your cover for treatment of conditions you were aware of or had already had when \nyou joined depends on the type of cover your group has chosen and what you told us about your \nmedical history when you joined. \nAm I covered for treatment of any conditions I was aware of when I joined? \nWe call conditions you were aware of when you joined pre-existing conditions. \nThe definition of pre-existing condition \nA pre-existing condition is any disease, illness or injury that: \nx you have received medication, advice or treatment for in the five years before the \nstart of your cover, or \nx you have experienced symptoms of in the five years before the start of your cover \nwhether or not the condition was diagnosed. \nOn your membership certificate, you\u2019ll see a section called \u2018Your cover for existing conditions\u2019. This \nwill tell you which underwriting terms you joined on. Here are the options: \nx Fully underwritten (or full medical underwriting) \nx Continuing medical exclusions \nx Medical history disregarded \nx Moratorium. \nIn the following panels, we\u2019ve explained how each of these work, but if you\u2019re unsure about your \ncover for treatment of pre-existing conditions it\u2019s always best to contact us. \nFully underwritten or full medical underwriting \n\u2018Fully underwritten\u2019 means we asked you for details of your medical history, including any  \npre-existing conditions, before you joined. We then worked out your cover based on the \ninformation we received. \nWe have listed any special terms or exclusions on your membership certificate \u2013 please check \nthis carefully. For example, you may not have cover for something specific if you have had that \ncondition in the past. Your certificate will also show whether we can remove the exclusion after a \nperiod of time. \n \nContinuing medical exclusions \nIf you joined us on \u2018continuing medical exclusions\u2019 terms, we are carrying on your exclusions for \nmedical conditions from your previous health insurer. This normally means we only asked you a \nfew brief medical questions. \nWe have listed any special terms or exclusions on your membership certificate \u2013 please check \nthis carefully. For example, you may not have cover for something specific if you have had that \ncondition in the past.

Your membership certificate will show when your moratorium started. \n \nMedical history disregarded \nIf you joined us on \u2018medical history disregarded\u2019 terms, we accepted any pre-existing \nconditions you might have had when you joined. We normally only do this if we are continuing \ncover from a different health insurer or from a company membership, or for a newborn baby \nwho was added to your membership. \n \nMoratorium \nIf you joined us on moratorium terms, you won\u2019t have cover for treatment of any conditions you \nhad in the five years before you joined. This includes if you had symptoms of a condition that \nhadn\u2019t been diagnosed.

This means that it may not cover \nyou for treatment of conditions that are likely to last a long time or come back (chronic \nconditions). However, there are particular situations where we can cover treatment for these \nkinds of conditions. \nDoes my membership cover me for treatment of conditions that last a long time or come back \n(chronic conditions)? \nYour membership does not cover you for conditions that: \nx come back (recur); or \nx are likely to continue for a while; or \nx are long-term. \nBecause we don\u2019t cover ongoing, recurring long-term treatment for chronic conditions, this \nmeans we will not cover: \nx monitoring a medical condition; or \nx any treatment that only offers temporary relief of your symptoms, rather than dealing with the \nunderlying condition; or \nx routine follow-up consultations. \nHowever, please see the notes on treatment for cancer and heart conditions below, as there are \nsome exceptions to these rules. \nWhat are acute conditions and chronic conditions? \nLike most health insurers, we use the Association of British Insurers\u2019 definitions for these. \nAcute condition \nAn acute condition is a disease, illness or injury that is likely to respond quickly to treatment \nthat aims to return you to the state of health you were in immediately before suffering the \ndisease, illness or injury, or that leads to your full recovery. \nChronic condition \nA chronic condition is a disease, illness or injury that has one or more of the following \ncharacteristics: \nx It needs ongoing or long-term monitoring through consultations, examinations,  \ncheck-ups or tests \nx It needs ongoing or long-term control or relief of symptoms \nx It requires your rehabilitation, or for you to be specially trained to cope with it \nx It continues indefinitely \nx It has no known cure \nx It comes back or is likely to come back. \nWhat happens if a condition I have is a chronic condition? \nIf your condition is chronic, unfortunately there will be a limit to how long we cover your \ntreatment. If we are not able to continue to cover your treatment, we will tell you beforehand so \nthat you can decide whether to start paying for the treatment yourself, or to transfer to the NHS. \nHow does this affect my cover for cancer treatment? \nThere is a full explanation of how we cover cancer treatment in section 4 of this handbook.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3970, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec979d83-a766-47e4-8f60-759a02d125ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec979d83-a766-47e4-8f60-759a02d125ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_path": "data/pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3483406, "creation_date": "2025-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d89a2650-9f24-4434-a086-4832a3c92b0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_path": "data/pb116349-business-health-select-handbook-1024-pdfa.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3483406, "creation_date": "2025-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-19"}, "hash": "88ee6a87e04e4decdbe535b85031c4005414ea967f4044c122da6c089aa5359a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Page 16 \nHow does this affect my cover for treatment of heart conditions? \n9 Extra cover if you have an Out-patient Option \nIf you have an Out-patient Option, we will make an exception for treating some heart conditions. \nIf you have any of the following surgery on your heart, we will carry on paying for long-term \nmonitoring, consultations, check-ups, scans and examinations related to the surgery.

Some conditions are likely to always need ongoing treatment or are likely to recur. This is \nparticularly the case if the condition is likely to get worse over time. An example is Crohn\u2019s disease \n(inflammatory bowel disease). \nIf you have one of these conditions, we will contact you to tell you when we will stop cover for \ntreatment of the condition. We will contact you so that you can then decide whether to start \npaying for the treatment yourself, or to transfer to the NHS. \n3.6 > Paying the specialists and practitioners that treat you - cover for all \nmembers \nDoes my plan cover the full fees charged by specialists? \nIf your treatment is covered, we will pay different amounts depending on what kind of \narrangement we have with your specialist. \nx Fee-approved specialist. Using a fee-approved specialist gives you the maximum reassurance, \nas we pay all their fees. If we book your appointment for you we will book it with a fee-approved \nspecialist. \nx Fee-limited specialist. You may need to pay some costs yourself. \nx Specialists we do not pay for. We do not pay any of their costs. \nWe use these arrangements for anaesthetists too \u2013 please also see below if you think your \ntreatment will involve an anaesthetist. \nVery occasionally the arrangement we have with a specialist may change, for example a \nfee-approved specialist may move to the fee-limited specialist category. This means that what \nwe  will pay for treatment with that specialist may also change.

We will be happy to \nsource a specialist whose fees we will cover. \n \nSchedule of procedures and fees \nThis is a list of the fees that we pay. \n\u00bb  You can find it at axahealth.co.uk/fees, or call us on 0800 206 1808 and we\u2019ll send you a \ncopy \nWhat about anaesthetists? \nIf you think that your treatment will involve an anaesthetist, please check with your specialist \nwhich anaesthetist they will use and let us know before your treatment starts. We will then be able \nto tell you whether we pay their fees (see \u2018Fee-approved specialists\u2019 above). \nIf you don\u2019t know which anaesthetist your specialist will use, we will do everything we can to let \nyou know if they often use an anaesthetist that we do not pay in full. \nAs with other specialists, if the anaesthetist is \u2019fee-limited\u2019 or a specialist that we do not pay, you \nwill have to pay some or all of the fees yourself. Please see the panels above for the different  \narrangements we have with specialists. \nSpecialist appointment booking service \nWe can source specialists for you, and can even book your appointment for you.

This section explains \nthe differences. If a specific aspect of your cover is not mentioned here, the standard cover \ndescribed elsewhere in your handbook applies. \nAbout your cover for cancer treatment \nWe will cover treatment for any new cancer that starts after you join. We will also cover that \ncancer if it comes back and you are still a member. \nIf you have exclusions to do with cancer because of your past medical history, we will not cover \nyour treatment if this cancer comes back. \n\u00bb For more details of how we cover treatment of pre-existing medical conditions, see section 3.4 \nExperienced nurses and case managers \nOur registered nurses and case managers provide support over the phone and \nhave years of experience of supporting cancer patients and their families. \nWhen you call, we will put you in touch with a nurse or case manager who will \nthen support you throughout your treatment. \nYour nurse or case manager will be happy to speak to your specialist or doctor \ndirectly if you need them to check any details. They can also give you guidance \non what to expect during treatment and how to talk about your illness to \nfriends and family. \nCover for all members \nIf you have day-patient or out-patient radiotherapy or chemotherapy on the NHS, and your plan \nwould have covered that treatment, we will make a cash payment. \n9 Extra cover if you have the Extra Care Option \nIf you have the Extra Care Option, we will also make a cash payment for in-patient treatment \non the NHS (as well as out-patient and day-patient radiotherapy or chemotherapy). \nCancer treatment at home  \nWe will pay in full for a nurse from a healthcare services supplier that we have a contract with to \ngive you drug treatment to kill cancer cells. You can have this treatment at home or another place \nthat is appropriate. \nThis could be chemotherapy by intravenous drip, an injection, delivery of oral chemotherapy \ntablets or other treatment. Your cancer treatment needs to be under the supervision of a \nspecialist and we must agree to it first. \nDo the rules about chronic or recurring conditions apply to cancer?  \nWe don\u2019t apply our rules about chronic or recurring conditions to cancer.

If you then incur more \ncosts in the next membership year, even if it\u2019s for the same condition, we will take the excess off \nthat claim.  \nx If your claim goes over your renewal, we will take the excess off the amount we pay for your \nclaim before renewal, then we will take the excess off the amount we pay for your claim after \nrenewal.  \nIf you have any questions about how your excess works, please call us on 0800 587 0955.  \n\u00bb You can find an example of how we work out the excess below \nClaims that you do not have to pay an excess for \nIf you claim for any of the following, you will not need to pay an excess:  \nx NHS radiotherapy and chemotherapy cash benefit \nx external prosthesis \nx consultations with the AXA Doctor at Hand service \nx hotel accommodation benefit \nx If you have the Extra Care Option: NHS cash benefit or chiropody or podiatry \nx if you have the Dentist and Optician Cashback Option: any claim for dentist\u2019s fees, optician\u2019s fees \nor eye tests \nx if you have the Extra Cancer Cover Option: any claim for wigs, head coverings or hospice \ndonations. \nAn example of how we work out the excess \nExcesses can be complicated, so we\u2019ve included an example of how it works here.  \nSituation:  \nx Ann has the Enhanced Out-patient Option, which has a limit of \u00a31,000 for out-patient \ntreatment (as shown in the benefit table on page 5) \nx She also has an excess of \u00a3100. \nHere\u2019s how it works: \n1. Ann has a medical problem that is covered by her Option. She claims for \u00a3700 for out-patient \ntreatment (her first claim for the year). \n2. We apply the \u00a3100 excess, so Ann pays the first \u00a3100 of the claim.  \n3. We then pay the remaining \u00a3600 directly to the hospital. \n4. We take the whole \u00a3700 cost of the claim off Ann\u2019s \u00a31,000 limit for out-patient treatment \n(not just the \u00a3600 that we paid). So she now has \u00a3300 left for out-patient treatment for the \nrest of the year.  \n5. A month later, but in the same membership year, Ann needs some more out-patient \ntreatment that\u2019s covered by her Option. This costs \u00a3450.  \nAnn doesn\u2019t need to pay any excess, because she has already paid her full excess in this \nmembership year. But she only has \u00a3300 left from her Enhanced Out-patient Option limit.  \nSo we\u2019ll pay \u00a3300 towards the cost. Ann will need to pay the remaining \u00a3150 herself to the \nhospital. \n5.3 > Keeping us informed  \nIf any of your personal details change, it\u2019s important that you let us know as soon as possible. If \nyou\u2019re unsure whether the change is important, it\u2019s best to tell us and we can explain if it affects \nyour membership.  \nChanges you must tell us about? \nIf you send us any form, and anything changes between the time you send the form and the time we \nconfirm that we have made the change shown in the form, you must tell us.  \n5.4 > If you move abroad \nIf you move outside of the United Kingdom, you won\u2019t be able keep your current plan and  you will \nnot be able to make any claims for treatment.
